### functions


1. create a function called greet that prints "hello everyone" when called

2. create a function called add_two that takes two numbers and prints their sum

3. create a function called say_name that takes one parameter (name) and prints "hi name!"

4. create a function called is_even that takes a number and returns True if even, False if odd

5. create a function called square that takes a number and returns its square

6. create a function called max_of_two that takes two numbers and returns the bigger one

7. create a function called calculate_total that takes three numbers (price, quantity, discount)  
   discount is in percent (example 10 for 10%)  
   return final amount after discount

8. create a function called count_vowels that takes a string and returns how many vowels (a e i o u) it has  
   (lowercase only)

9. create a function called reverse_string that takes a string and returns it backwards  
   (do not use [::-1], use loop)

10. create a function called factorial that takes a positive integer n and returns n!  
    (example: 5! = 120)  
    use recursion or loop (your choice)

11. create a function called find_common that takes two lists and returns a new list with items that appear in both lists  
    (do not use set, use loop)

12. create a function called is_prime that takes a number and returns True if it is prime, False otherwise  
    (prime = only divisible by 1 and itself, numbers > 1)

13. create a function called fibonacci that takes n and prints first n fibonacci numbers  
    (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...)
Try to write each function with:
- proper def line
- good parameter names
- return when needed
- some test calls below the function
# example format you can follow:
def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
print(is_even(10))   # True
print(is_even(7))    # False
